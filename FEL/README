# Free Energy Landscape (FEL) Calculation README

## Welcome

Welcome to the FEL calculation README file. This document outlines the step-by-step process used to compute the free energy landscape. The instructions below are designed to guide you through the necessary steps to reproduce our FEL computations.

## System Requirements

- A 64-bit Linux operating system.
- Maestro software for initial trajectory analysis.
- GROMACS software for free energy calculations.
- Python with the `xpm2png.py` script for image generation.

## Step 1: Preparation of the "RMSD_RoG.xvg" File

1. Use the **Simulation Events Analyze** feature in **Maestro** to analyze the dynamic trajectory files from your molecular dynamics simulation.
2. Export the analysis results, which include the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and radius of gyration (RoG) of the protein's main chain, into a CSV file named "RMSD_RoG.csv".
3. Open the CSV file in a text editor and remove all headers and annotations.
4. Replace the comma separator with spaces or tabs.
5. Save the modified file with the extension ".xvg".

## Step 2: Execution of the `gmx sham` Command

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your "RMSD_RoG.xvg" file using the `cd` command.
2. Run the following GROMACS command to perform the free energy calculations:
   ```bash
   gmx sham -tsham 310 -nlevels 100 -f RMSD_RoG.xvg -ls gibbs.xpm -g gibbs.log -lsh enthalpy.xpm -lss entropy.xpm
## This command will generate several output files, including "gibbs.xpm", "gibbs.log", and "bindex.ndx", which are essential for further analysis.

## Step 3: Generation of the 2D FEL Image

Use the Python script "xpm2png.py" to process the "gibbs.xpm" file and generate a 2D FEL image:

```bash
python xpm2png.py -ip yes -f gibbs.xpm

## Step 4: Selection of Low Energy Conformations

Utilize the "gibbs.log" and "bindex.ndx" files to identify the lowest energy conformations from your molecular dynamics simulation. These files are instrumental in selecting conformations for subsequent validation with a docking program.

##Accessing the Files

All relevant scripts, data examples, and detailed method descriptions are available on our GitHub repository: IL4I1_Script.
